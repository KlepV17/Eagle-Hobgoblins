 eagle_hobgoblins_will_of_order_reform:0 "The Will of Order"
 eagle_hobgoblins_will_of_order_reform_desc:0 "To rule is to bring order, and to bring order is to rule. Chaos claws at our growing empire, attempting to take back that which we have fought and died to achieve. There is only one man in the world who can lead us through this darkness, our Denunransun. If we have faith in him, faith in order, our empire shall span the world."
 

 flavor_nire.1.t:0 "A Dream in a Starless Night"
 flavor_nire.1.a:0 "Gentlemen, we have work to do."
 flavor_nire.1.d:0 "Another night with no food after another failed hunt. Taiji had sorrowfully grown acustom to hungry and dark nights, his village unable to muster strength to even defend itself. When he was a boy all he could do was to huddle around the fire with the village elders and hear their tales. Tales of magic, of empire, and the world beyond the mountains. Now he is a man grown, with little time for fantasy. But still, he can't help but wonder, what is the destiny of his people? To huddle around the fire waiting for better days? \n\nNo. This can not be the fate of his own clildren, his own people. He will turn this lone fire into millions, blazing across the world. On his 19th name day, at the break of dawn, he set out for the capital; what he found was little more than an oversized village stuffed with bureaucrats who had never gone to bed without a meal, squabbling over taxes."
 
 flavor_nire.2.t:0 "The Ascendant Dragon"
 flavor_nire.2.a:0 "Soon the Titans shall clash."
 flavor_nire.2.d:0 "There were many among us who were sated after our most recent conquest. It is true our kingdom stretches for thousands kilometers and far beyond the valleys that were once all we knew. Alas, would it that we could rest. Rumors have reached us; our fallen bretheren now command a vast empire, one that may surpass our own. To sit idle would invite defeat. \n\nThe Denunransun has called a conclave of the most experienced warlocks in the realm with the purpose of scrying the lands beyond our borders. Inexplicably, in the first few moments of channeling the incantation, a font of magical energy burst forth from out Denunransun. The room was alight with panic as he fell to the ground, though he quickly rose. He spoke of his visions: \n\nTo the west a vast plane full of monsterous Centaur and a civilization of Humans, cut off from their kin.\n\nTo the east a horde of a different sort; fearless riders of beasts trampling all before them.\n\nAnd to the south, a vast continent of weak kingdoms with even weaker rulers. All doomed to fall to the 'Great Command.' \n\n'If we do not stop our brother, they shall consume us all' The Denunransun declared. At once, every warlock present bent the knee, and swore personal service him.\n\nIf we are to slay a titan, we must first become one ourselves."
 
 flavor_nire.3.t:0 "The Hour of Truth"
 flavor_nire.3.a:0 "Find me someone who will sell our secrets."
 flavor_nire.3.d:0 "Despite our recent prepartions, the Command's rate of expansion rivals our own.\n\nTo kill the Command, utterly and once and for all, discisive action must be taken. Conventional wistom dictates whoever holds the high ground is assured to win, and we shall make that a reality. Our capital lies high above the Godswall, where a great volume of water plunges below. Were we to lure them up this narrow passage and let them believe they had the upper hand, we could trap their armies and slaughter them to a man."
 
 flavor_nire.4.t:0 "A Path Through the Cliffs"
 flavor_nire.4.a:0 "I say again, 'Let Them Come'"
 flavor_nire.4.d:0 "Our preparations are complete. Now we must put our hopes in the power of our mages and the strength our walls."
 
 flavor_nire.5.t:0 "The Siege of Kuene"
 flavor_nire.5.a:0 "And the Godswall was no more."
 flavor_nire.5.d:0 "The Garrison Commander of Kuene Citadel was informed of the plot a mere week before the great host of the Command arrivet at his gates; barely enough time to reinforce the walls. He knew vagueley of the plan: lure the hobgoblin army up the Godswall path, trap them benith the fortress, and burn them out with fire magic. That is why it was no surprise to him to see so many mages moving about as of late. They all seeming frantic, as if the Day of Ashen Skies were to happen any day now. \n\nHe put such worries to rest as he patrolled the battlements once more, keeping an eye on the Command Camp, dimly lit by camp fire. It almost passed him by when one of the camp fires, near their artilery encampment, started to grow brighter and brighter. At first it was as bright as a well lit hearth, then, almost at once, it grew to be as bright as the sun. The Garrison Commander of Kuene had just enough time to laugh at the misfortune of the Command before the bright light swallowed him as well, then the entirety of the Godswall. \n\n\nA lucky sheep hearder would later recall the incident:\n'It was as if the sun itself had fallen on Halann, come and gone in just an instant, taking away the fort, the army, and the godswall in one fell swoop. I thought myself lucky and the danger passed when the thunder came, all the water held back by the wall surged forth, wiping clean everything and everyone. It was only later when I learned the full extent of the destruction. Entire villages swept away, crops ripped from the earth. My homeland, destroyed. \n\n'Who would do such a thing?' an onlooker asked.\n\nWith rage in his eyes he answered: 'The Command'"
 
 flavor_nire.6.t:0 "Searching The Ruins"
 flavor_nire.6.a:0 "They're in the walls!"
 flavor_nire.6.d:0 "Fulin was extatic! His first assignment from the Iona Saothar Warlock Academy: exploring the ruins of Verkal Dromak. He was catagorizing fungus when he came upon the most perculiar thing, an amulet stuck to the wall. \n\n'Surely the goblins would have plundered it when they squatted here?' He thought. \n\nNot thinking about the consequences, he grabbed the amulet off the wall and put it on. Suddenly, walls sprung from the floors, trapping him against the glowing amulet stand. \n\n'Glowing' He thought 'Since when was this thing glowing?'\n\nStill not thinking about the consequences, he tried casting a spell at the stand. It exploded, destroying the fabricated wall constraining him and revealing a hidden passageway. Without alerting anyone, he ventured deeper and deerper into the hold, until he discovered the strangest room. \n\nA vast cavern filled with glass containers, large enough to almost fit him. Fulin approached the nearest one, and cast a fire spell to better illuminate what was inside. To his horror, a dwarf opened his eyes and stared back at him. In an instant the cavern brightened, and a pungent smell filled the cavern. Hordes of dwarves were starting to wake up from a slumber that should not have been disturbed."
 
 flavor_nire.7.t:0 "Meeting the Vanquished"
 flavor_nire.7.a:0 "'Perhaps we can find some common ground'"
 flavor_nire.7.d:0 "The leader of the Malachite Dwarves was brought in chains before the Denunransun. Bloodied from battle he, was trying not to think of all the ways these savage Hobgoblins would kill him then his people, each horror in his mind brought him rage. He would kill this Denunransun, or die in the attempt.\n\nWhen he saw the Hobgoblin leader, he was surprised by the red hue of his skin, and was even more surprised when his chains were removed from his hands. 'A perfect opportunitry' He thought. Pretending to itch his beard, be removed a thin blade of metal nestled within and approaced the Denunransun, poised to strike. Inexplicably, the metal hidden in his hand started to warm, then sear his skin until he was forced to drop it. With panic in his eyes he looked at the Hobgoblin, who was unexpected smiling. \n\n'I am told your people are powerful mages,' The Hobgoblin leader said..."

 flavor_nire.8.a:0 "What have we done?"
 flavor_nire.8.d:0 "Boom"
 
 flavor_nire.9.t:0 "The Ruination of Shamakhad"
 flavor_nire.9.a:0 "They will pay!"
 flavor_nire.9.d:0 "Godswall has been destroyed, hundreds of thousands have died in the resulting floods."
 
 flavor_nire.10.t:0 "The End of Artificery"
 flavor_nire.10.a:0 "It is the Age of Magic Once More"
 flavor_nire.10.d:0 "Eagle Hobgoblins restrict all artificery research and disband all state artificery organizations."
 
 flavor_nire.11.t:0 "The Politcal Fallout"
 flavor_nire.11.a:0 "We shall abandon our overlords!"
 flavor_nire.11.d:0 "The Command has gone too far, they stand alone."
 
 flavor_nire.12.t:0 "It Reaches Out"
 flavor_nire.12.a:0 "None shall escape our reach."
 flavor_nire.12.d:0 "We know the answer to the letter before we send it. \n\n'Henceforth you shall declare artificery illegal and disband any guilds practicing or relating to the practice of...' \n\nOn and on the letter goes, 113 specific points against artificery, written by the Denunransun himself. Surely he must know the letters will be ignored? After all, who would listen to an empire on the opposite side of the world; they may be formidable, but we are wall outside their reach. \n\n'Send them' he says, 'For when we show up on their shores, in their lands, and in their homes: they will only have themselves to blame.'"
