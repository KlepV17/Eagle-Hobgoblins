 V20_long_flight_north1_desc:0 "O’er peaks, through ice, haggard wings, no rest\nNot storm, nor spear, nor spell, can wrest\nThe barbs, loss marred, to sing, my loves\nThrough pain, in hope, so now I shove\nMy clutch to fly to brighter days, so fly, my loves, to Valley’s rays  \n\n- Unknown Nuzenapu Matriarch’s Lament, circa 40s-50s AA\n\nThe Day of Ashen Skies forever scarred Šad Siadan: mountains crumbled, killing clouds spanned the horizon, and the already harsh land unraveled into a desolate hellscape. The Siadan Matriarchy struggled to maintain order in its wake, yet they could not stave off decades of starvation, earthquakes, and falling fireballs. With nothing but a dying hope, several harpy flocks braved the world-ending zephyrs for a brighter future beyond their ancestral roosts. Up, up, up, they pressed through ice, flame, gale, and darkness to eclipse the very Serpentspine Mountains. Droves died in the exodus, but for those who arrived on the opposing cliffs, they found a valley as harsh as their homeland yet welcoming as a plush pillow: Nomsyulhan."

Preening their wounds in blessed rest, the harpies encountered at first only the monastic Soulseeker Ogres, beasts, and the terrifying unodeke. Lacking compatible reproduction, the remaining matriarchs rallied their flocks to search for suitable mates. As if guided by the same blessed winds that carried them from Siadan, the Nuzenapu Harpies observed an equally weary and scared group arriving upon the plateau: the Eagle Hobgoblins. By both loneliness and necessity, the two peoples bound together in destiny, forever changing the shape of Nomsyulhan."

By the end of the 1st century AA, they turned their struggling clans into a coalition of aerial and arcane supremacy that could challenge Soulseeker Ogres in their imposing Temple-Holdfasts. As the generations wore on, the Eagle Hobgoblins domesticated the unruly dragonnel and joined the skies, earning both respect and teasing from their feathery comrades. With harpy infantry and hobgoblin cavalry in loving tandem, the two established the premiere military power atop the Pillar of Heaven."

Dubbed the featherdust trade, these powder peddlers simultaneously served as magical mine and meister, plucking feathers and trimming nail-clippings to sell raw or as a damestear-infused poultice. These merchants, vibrant and boisterous about their own talents and lineages, spun their melodious pitches into cultural touchstones."

Throughout Nomsyulhan, the unodeke, or “strange beasts” as the hobgoblins learned from the ogres, plagued their new homelands; No place was safe from these deadly and territorial creatures. Hobgoblin and harpy warriors ranging from dedicated duos to entire hunting parties sought unodeke as an act of heroism and service for both societies. These aerial hunts also deepened harpy-hobgoblin relations and created a war-ready pool of deadly harpy infantry and dragonnel riders."

Over-preening with dread, a harpy coalition found allies with the ascendant Kuenan Nirokyu and their biracial capital of Waben Donpun; After their conquest of The’as Achur in 1419, these hobgoblins migrated from the mountain to settle a new capital in the Beacon of White-Gold. As matriarchs fumed and lamented their lost loves, Kuenan Nirokyu’s rulers formalized a pact with the harpies. In spring and fall, Kuenan Nirokyu would conscript eligible mates for a season, and in exchange, the Nuzenapu Harpies would be granted their own lands: Zoherin and the former capital Waben Donpun. In exchange, they were obliged to defend Kuenan Nirokyu’s northern frontier and fly beneath their ally’s warbanner when called."

Unlike other harpy settlements built in cliffs or atop plateaus, Waben Donpun rests directly within the mountain, accessible only by ominous cavern breaches high up the ascent. Gargantuan enough to sport its own cool microclimate, magical pyres and sunbeams pouring through calcified sinkholes in the dome illuminate the enclosed city. Ornate cavern-hewn buildings and verdant common areas line Waben Donpun’s inner nooks, ledges, and pillars, and sprawling earth-shaped walkways used by flightless denizens connect the various districts. Mini-reservoirs of rain and melt runoff supply Waben Donpun via simple aqueducts, though the central cavern’s bottom also boasts a non-potable, metal-heavy basin that glistens like emerald."
